\subsection Overview

The <b>SPARC</b> package is an educational tool for solving the sparse page rank problem using <b>spectral bisection</b>, <b>graph coarsening</b>, and <b>compact sparse column</b> (CSC) format. 
This code was originally written as a final project for Dr. George Biros's <em>Parallel Algorithms</em> class.

\subsection ex Example Results

Below are results obtained using SPARC. 


The figure on the left is original data from facebook that has 88234 non-zero entries and 16466 number of non-zero entries on the off diagonal. The figure on the left is the same data after spectral bisection. The number of off diagonal entries reduces to 1266.

The figure on the left is original DBLP data that has 1049866 non-zero entries and 628800 number of non-zero entries on the off diagonal. The figure on the left is the same data after spectral bisection. The number of off diagonal entries reduces to 350038. 
<img src="DBLP_SBC0.png" style="float: center; height: 30%; width: 60%; margin-left: 15%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
The figure on the left is the same original DBLP data as above with 1049866 non-zero entries and 628800 number of non-zero entries on the off diagonal. The figure on the left is the data after four levels of coarsening followed by spectral bisection. The number of off diagonal entries reduces to 523194.
